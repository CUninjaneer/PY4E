JavaScript Object Notation

    Douglas Crockford - "Discoveror" of JSON
    Object literal notation in JavaScript
    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kc8BAR7SHJI
        Discovered in 2001.
        It already existed, but he noticed it's potential for use in serializing data.
        Born from JavaScript, but he thought it could be and should be an independent language or specification.
        He found that he would have to convince people that JSON was a standard in order to be able to use it in his work.  So he bought JSON.org, and made a web page declaring JSON was a standard, put some description of what it is, and that worked.
        JSON is static and permanent.  There are no different versions.

JavaScript Object Notation

    JSON represents data as nested "lists" and "dictionaries."

    Example:
        import json

        data = '''
        {
          "name" : "Chuck",
          "phone" : {
            "type" : "intl",
            "number" : "+1 734 303 4456"
           },
           "email" : {
             "hide" : "yes"
           }
        }'''

        info = json.loads(data)
        print('Name:', info["name"])
        print('Hide:', info["email"]["hide"])

    Note the use of the curly braces and key-value pairs.  This is very similar to a Dictionary in Python, but JavaScript calls it an Object.
    Use the json.loads method to take that JSON data and put it into a Python Dictionary that you can work with ("info" in the example above).
    To get something at the top level of the dictionary, it's just dictionary[key].
    To drill down, it's dictionary[key][key]...
                        |______ ______|
                               V
                               This returns a subdictionary.  Then you call the key you want or continue drilling down in this manner as far as necessary.
