1.4 Writing Paragraphs of Code
------------------------------


Sequential Steps
  x = 2
  print(x)
  x = x + 2
  print(x)


Conditional Steps
  x = 5
  if x < 10:
    print ("Smaller")
  if x > 20:
    print ("Bigger")

  print("Finis")


Repeated Steps
  n = 5
  while n > 0 :
    print(n)
    n = n - 1
  print("Blastoff")


Entering and exiting conditional statements and loops is performed with
indentation, not with commands/functions.
You can nest conditional and loops within each other using indentation as well.
